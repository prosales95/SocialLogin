# SocialLogin

=======

This repository contains a Social Login as the start page of a project of mine. It uses firebase to manage the account logs. You can login with FB, Twt, GitHub or Goog, thereby I utiliye the different API available

### Getting the base project set up
First clone the project in your desired location.
Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. After having Ionic all set up run `ionic serve` to launch the local server.
